Introduction
============

Welcome to the Med Metrics project, a comprehensive toolkit for the evaluation of machine learning models in medical contexts.

Purpose
-------

This package offers a unique suite of metrics, compatibility assessments, and bootstrapping techniques specifically designed to assess the performance and impact of models in healthcare.

Features
--------

- Specialized Medical Metrics: Functions for advanced metrics such as Number Needed to Treat (NNT) across decision thresholds, average height of NNT vs. treated curves, and net benefit analysis.
- Curves for Evaluation: Generate various curves like NNT vs. treated, and net benefit curves, essential for visual and quantitative model analysis.
- Compatibility Metrics: Evaluate prediction compatibility across model updates or between different models, crucial for maintaining trust in evolving medical ML applications.
- Bootstrap Evaluation: Robust tools for performing bootstrap evaluations, enabling detailed performance comparisons across different machine learning models.
